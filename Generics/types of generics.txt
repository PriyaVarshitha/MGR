Normal Generics:
Normal generics allow you to define generic classes, interfaces, and 
methods without any restrictions on the type parameter. The type parameter can 
represent any type, including classes, interfaces, or even other type parameters. 
For example:

class Box<T> {
    private T item;

    public T getItem() {
        return item;
    }

    public void setItem(T item) {
        this.item = item;
    }
}

In the above example, T is a type parameter that can represent any type.
There are no constraints or limitations placed on T, and it can be substituted
 with any class or interface.

Bounded Generics:
Bounded generics, on the other hand, introduce restrictions or 
bounds on the type parameters. They allow you to specify that the type parameter 
must be a specific type or a subtype/supertype of a specific type.

Upper Bounded Generics:
Upper bounded generics restrict the type parameter to be a specific type or any 
of its subtypes. It is denoted using the extends keyword. 
For example:
class Box<T extends Number> {
    // ...
}
In this case, the type parameter T must be a subclass of Number or 
Number itself. This allows the usage of methods and properties specific 
to the Number class within the generic class.



Wildcard generics:
In Java allow you to represent unknown types or types that are not explicitly 
specified. They are denoted by the "?" symbol and can be used in various 
contexts to provide flexibility in generic type declarations. 
There are three main uses of wildcard generics:

Unbounded Wildcards: <?>
An unbounded wildcard represents an unknown type. 
It can be used as a generic type argument when you want to work with a 
collection without specifying its element type. 
For example:
List<?> list = new ArrayList<>();

In this case, the list can hold elements of any type, but you cannot add elements to it (except for null). 
You can only read elements from the list as Object references.

Upper Bounded Wildcards: <? extends Type>
An upper bounded wildcard restricts the unknown type to be a specific type or any of its subtypes. 
It is denoted by ? extends Type. 
For example:
List<? extends Number> numbers = new ArrayList<>();

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class UpperBoundedWildcardExample {
    public static double sum(List<? extends Number> numbers) {
        double total = 0.0;
        for (Number number : numbers) {
            total += number.doubleValue();
        }
        return total;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> integers = new ArrayList<>();
        integers.add(1);
        integers.add(2);
        integers.add(3);

        double result = sum(integers);
        System.out.println("Sum: " + result);
    }
}

Here, the numbers list can hold elements of type Number or any of its subtypes (e.g., Integer, Double). 
You can read elements from this list as instances of the upper bound type (Number), but you cannot add elements to it.

Lower Bounded Wildcards: <? super Type>
A lower bounded wildcard restricts the unknown type to be a specific type or any of its supertypes. 
It is denoted by ? super Type. 
For example:
List<? super Integer> integers = new ArrayList<>();

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class LowerBoundedWildcardExample {
    public static void addIntegers(List<? super Integer> integers) {
        integers.add(1);
        integers.add(2);
        integers.add(3);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Number> numbers = new ArrayList<>();
        addIntegers(numbers);

        System.out.println("Numbers: " + numbers);
    }
}

In this case, the integers list can hold elements of type Integer or any of its supertypes (e.g., Number, Object). 
You can add elements of the lower bound type (Integer) or its subtypes to this list, but you can only read elements as Object references.

Wildcard generics provide flexibility when working with collections of unknown types or when you want to define more generic method signatures.
 They allow you to write code that can operate on a wide range of types without being overly specific.
